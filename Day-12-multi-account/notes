IN THIS WE CREATED INFRA IN DIFFERENT AWS ACCOUNTS BY TERRAFORM.

BEFORE EXECUTING WE NEED TO CREATE A AWS PROFILE WHICH MEANS
ALREADY WE HAVE OUR AWS ACCOUNT ACCESS KEY AND SECRETE KEY [ AWS CONFIGURE]
WE NEED TO ADD ANOTHER ACCOUNT PROFILE TO IT By aws configure --profile dev
dev profile will be added and we use this to create infra on other account.


we can use this by following way
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-2"
  profile = "dev"
}
