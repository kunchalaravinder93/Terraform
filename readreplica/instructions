Do it one by one RDS first and Read replica next.

First create RDS first main.tf / rds.tf
terraform apply -auto-approve
 wait until RDS is created
Then write read-replica code and terraform apply again


In read-repica code we have data source where it gives rds location we have given provider = aws. secondary 
After creating RDS update provider to with alias = "secondary"


if you want to create read replica in another region give one more provider with another region.
Add provider block in read replica code. provider =  aws.read  [alias]
