We need S3 bucket before we use it as Backend.
similarly dynamoDB Table need to be created to use it for state lock [ when two users use same command there will be an error to rectify this we use dunamodb table to lock the command  till its execution is finished]
so first create S3 and DynamoDB table.
Then Add them in the backend.tf
=================================================
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "sanravi123"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-dynamo" # DynamoDB table used for state locking, note: first run day-4-s3-dynamodb resource then day-4-state-remote-backend
    encrypt        = true 
  }
}

to create dynamoDB table 
===============================
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "dynamodb-terraform-state-lock" {
  name = "terraform-state-lock-dynamo"
  hash_key = "LockID"
  read_capacity = 20
  write_capacity = 20
 
  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
