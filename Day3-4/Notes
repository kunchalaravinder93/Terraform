BACKEND S3
============
Backend is required to save statefile .
To create a backend we need to create S3 bucket first and create backend.tf 
Or you can create S3 from code and write backend after creating it.

DYNAMO DB TABLE
=============
DYNAMO DB table used to lock commands when two developers are working together.
To create a backend with dynamo DB we need to create S3 bucket along with Dynamo db table first and create backend.tf
when two users give terraform apply at a time dynamo db helps to lock the execution who ever gives the command first. and gives error for other person
SO other person can apply after excution of first user.


code for backend 
--------------------
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "sanravi123"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-dynamo" # DynamoDB table used for state locking, note: first run day-4-s3-dynamodb resource then day-4-state-remote-backend
    encrypt        = true 
  }
}
